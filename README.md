# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

## Our Goal

The objective of making this app was to solidify what I've learn't in the Dicee app. In this app I use the concept Stateless and Stateful Flutter widgets.

This is a magical 8 ball app, it will give you the answers to all the tricky questions in life. You can make the ball change at the press of a button.
